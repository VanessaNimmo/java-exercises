Invalid Input Data

If the input file is incorrectly formatted, the program will print an error message and then exit. It will also do this if the grid size defined in the setup file is larger than the maximum grid size allowed (which is also supplied by the user). 

If the locations of the live cell pairs are incorrectly formatted or outside the defined grid size, the program will ignore them.

Max Grid Size: The size of 56 is chosen as this is the maximum number of the chosen display emoji that fits on the demo screen.
